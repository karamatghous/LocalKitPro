In the app at hand, only\nthe authentication service is used, although you can decide to use more of their features. Please\nrefer to their [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs)\nas you deem necessary.\n\n## Set up your Firebase account\n\nThe documentation for this, can be found in the official documentation of the service, mentioned\nabove.\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo configure Firebase client library you have to open (or create) `.env` file in the project's root\nfolder and set the following variables as presented in your Firebase account settings:\n\n```shell\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=\n```\n\nIf you do not want to set up environment variables, settings can be applied simply on\nthe `firebaseConfig` object found in the `src/config.js` file.\n\n```js\nexport const firebaseConfig = {\n  apiKey: '',\n  appId: '',\n  authDomain: '',\n  messagingSenderId: '',\n  projectId: '',\n  storageBucket: ''\n};\n```\n\n## How it was implemented\n\nAs mentioned above, Firebase offers a set of components to help your development process, although\nthey're not used in the app.\n\nThe `firebase.auth` factory from the library is used to create and provide the authentication\nfeature to a context (which wraps the content of the `App` component).\n\nThis aforementioned context is then used in the component tree to access the `Auth` public methods.\nIt provides the user authentication status and user profile, if available.\n\n## How to use Firebase Auth Provider\n\nBy default, the project uses a mocked `JWT provider` (as in: it doesn't use an actual JWT based\nauthentication server). To make use of Amplify simply follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1. Replace the provider\n\nOpen `src/pages/_app.js` file and replace the following line:\n\n```js\nimport { AuthConsumer, AuthProvider } from '../contexts/jwt-context';\n```\n\nwith\n\n```js\nimport { AuthConsumer, AuthProvider } from '../contexts/firebase-auth-context';\n```\n\n### Step 2. Replace the hook context\n\nOpen `src/hooks/use-auth.js` file and replace the following line:\n\n```js\nimport { AuthContext } from '../contexts/jwt-context';\n```\n\nwith\n\n```js\nimport { AuthContext } from '../contexts/firebase-auth-context';\n```\n\n## How to use auth\n\n### Retrieve user profile\n\nIn the example below, you can find how it can be used in any component not just the `App`. Should\nyou want to use it in any other component, you'll have to import the `useAuth` hook and use it as\nneeded.\n\n```jsx\n// src/pages/index.js\nimport { useAuth } from '../hooks/use-auth';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n  const { user } = useAuth();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Email: {user.email}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n### Auth methods / actions\n\n> For simplicity and space limitations, the code below is used only to exemplify, actual code can be found in the components.\n\n```jsx\n// src/pages/index.js\nimport { useAuth } from '../hooks/use-auth';\n\nconst Home = () => {\n  const { signInWithEmailAndPassword } = useAuth();\n  \n  const handleLogin = () => {\n    // Email and password\n    signInWithEmailAndPassword('demo@devias.io', 'Password123!');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleLogin}>\n        Login\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Implemented flows\n\nCurrently, the app only covers the main flows:\n\n- Create user with email and password\n- Sign in with email and password\n- Sign in with popup (Google)\n- Logout\n","slug":"authentication-firebase","title":"Firebase"}},"__N_SSG":true}
